Designed and built a real-time facial recognition attendance system leveraging computer vision and machine learning
techniques to automate and streamline user attendance tracking.
•Developed a real-time face recognition pipeline using OpenCV with Haar Cascades for face detection and LBPH
(Local Binary Patterns Histogram) for identity recognition.
•Performed image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to improve recognition accuracy under
varying lighting and facial orientations.
Automated attendance logging with CSV file generation, enabling seamless storage and review of daily attendance
records.
•Built an interactive desktop GUI using Tkinter, allowing real-time camera feed, user registration, and attendance
tracking through an intuitive interface.
•Optimized system performance to support multiple users concurrently with minimal latency, ensuring
responsiveness and reliability in real-time use cases.
